ShellCms
 Version 1, 16 December 2015
 ---------------------------

 This software is an MVC framework for PHP. The name ShellCMS is somewhat misused as this is not in itself a CMS
 but was supposed to be one, until I added support for plugins and separated the the pure MVC framework and the CMS bits.
 The CMS plugin will be released later.
